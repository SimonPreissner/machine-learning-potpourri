#Distributional semantics: a very light tutorial

This is a light tutorial in distributional semantics. You will find some slides from my lectures, a bibliography, and also two hands-on practicals in the documents/ directory.

##Install the build dependencies
>I recommend using pip for installation:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

>On Ubuntu, you may have to run this first:

    `sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev`
    
>Alternatively, you can also look in requirements.txt and install dependencies manually.
