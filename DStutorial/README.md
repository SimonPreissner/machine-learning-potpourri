#Distributional semantics: a very light tutorial

This is a light tutorial in distributional semantics. You will find some slides from my lectures, a bibliography, and also two hands-on practicals in the documents/ directory.

##Useful reading

A very simple introduction to distributional semantics is available <a href="http://aurelieherbelot.net/research/distributional-semantics-intro/">here</a>. If you are interested in a more technical and comprehensive introduction, check out the papers by <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol37/JAIR-3705.pdf">Turney and Pantel (2010)</a> or <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Esc609/pubs/sem_handbook.pdf">Clark (2012)</a>. If you are hooked... have a look at the bibliography in the documents/ directory.

##Install the build dependencies
>I recommend using pip for installation:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

>On Ubuntu, you may have to run this first:

    `sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev`
    
>Alternatively, you can also look in requirements.txt and install dependencies manually.
