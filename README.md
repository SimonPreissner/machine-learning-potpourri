# Tutorials

This repo currently contains the code for some machine learning tutorials (with emphasis on language processing).

*NB: the introduction to distributional semantics, DSTutorial, is very out-of-date. Use it at your own risk!*


### Content of the repo

* **Agreement:** No machine learning without quality data. Learn about Cohen's kappa by doing some annotation yourself.
* **Authorship:** Naive Bayes. Who wrote this? Run some authorship attribution code.
* **FruitFly:** Dimensionality reduction. Experiment with a fruit fly neural architecture for hashing vectors.
* **RLcafe:** Reinforcement learning. Learn politeness rules to talk to your local caf√© owner. 
* **RNNCats:** Recurrent Neural Networks. Are you fed up with generating Shakespeare language models? Try those awesome ASCII cats!
* **SVMs:** Support Vector Machines. Classify web documents using representations from the [PeARS search engine](http://pearsearch.org/).
* **Translation:** Regression. Linguistically challenged? Learn a bilingual lexicon from an English and a Catalan semantic space.

Instructions for running the code are in the README of each directory. I do not guarantee the code will run under all python installations and all OSs! If you want to be sure things will run smoothly, open an account with the fantastic [pythonanywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com/) people and try the code under Python 3.5. It's been tested there!
