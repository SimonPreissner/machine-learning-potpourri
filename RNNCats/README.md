# The amazing RNN cats tutorial

In this tutorial, you will be using a slightly modified version of [Andrej Karpathy's RNN code](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) to do character-based language modeling.

Typical language modeling examples involve generating Shakespeare. It is often difficult to judge the quality of the output (unless you're a Shakespeare buff). So let's think of something else we can generate in a character-based fashion...

ASCII cats.

```
      /\_/\
 /\  / o o \
//\\ \~(*)~/
`  \/   ^ /
   | \|| ||
   \ '|| ||
    \)()-())
```

(This  fine example is taken from [this awesome page](http://www.asciiworld.com/-Cats-.html).)
